## üéì Phase 6: Advanced Methods üöß IN PROGRESS
*Goal: Implement working solvers using piece tracking + algorithms*

**Reality Check**: Current "solvers" use exhaustive search instead of proper algorithms. They only work on simple scrambles (1-10 moves). Need to rebuild with proper layer-by-layer approach.

### 6.1 Current Status - What's Broken
- ‚ùå **BeginnerSolver**: Uses A* search (8 moves deep max) - fails on 25-move scrambles
- ‚ùå **CFOP**: Uses A*/BFS search for fallbacks - timeouts on complex scrambles
- ‚ùå **Kociemba**: Uses iterative deepening (10 moves deep max) - slow (53s for 6-move scramble)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Root Cause**: All solvers try to find OPTIMAL solutions via exhaustive search
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Real Issue**: 25-move scramble needs 50-100 move solution, but we only search 8-10 moves deep

### 6.2 Engineering Plan - BeginnerSolver Rebuild

**Phase A: White Cross (4 edges)**
- [x] Framework: Loop through 4 white edges, check if solved, call solver function
- [ ] Edge location detection: Map each edge to its current Face/Row/Col position
- [ ] Move generation based on position:
  - [ ] Case 1: Edge on top layer ‚Üí rotate U until aligned, then F2/R2/B2/L2 to insert
  - [ ] Case 2: Edge on bottom layer ‚Üí F2/R2/B2/L2 to move to top, then insert
  - [ ] Case 3: Edge in middle layer ‚Üí F/R/B/L to move to top or bottom, then insert
  - [ ] Case 4: Edge on bottom but wrong orientation ‚Üí remove and reinsert correctly
- [ ] Orientation handling: Check if white is on correct face (Down) vs side face

**Phase B: White Corners (4 corners)**
- [ ] Corner location detection for each of 4 white corners
- [ ] Algorithm: Position corner in top layer above target slot
- [ ] Apply R U R' U' (sexy move) 1-5 times until corner slots in correctly
- [ ] Handle 3 orientation cases: white on top, white on right, white on front

**Phase C: Middle Layer (4 edges)**
- [ ] Locate each middle edge (edges without yellow/white)
- [ ] Move edge to top layer if not already there
- [ ] Identify left vs right insertion based on edge orientation
- [ ] Apply algorithms:
  - Right: U R U' R' U' F' U F
  - Left: U' L' U L U F U' F'

**Phase D: Yellow Cross (OLL Part 1)**
- [ ] Check current cross pattern (dot/L/line/cross)
- [ ] Apply F R U R' U' F' algorithm 1-3 times until cross formed
- [ ] No search needed - guaranteed to work within 3 applications

**Phase E: Orient Yellow Corners (OLL Part 2)**
- [ ] Count incorrectly oriented corners
- [ ] Position one wrong corner in top-right
- [ ] Apply Sune (R U R' U R U2 R') or Anti-Sune
- [ ] Rotate U and repeat until all yellow on top

**Phase F: Permute Corners (PLL Part 1)**
- [ ] Check if corners are in correct positions
- [ ] Find a solved corner (or pick any if none)
- [ ] Apply corner permutation algorithm (T-Perm or similar)
- [ ] Rotate U and check again, max 4 tries

**Phase G: Permute Edges (PLL Part 2)**
- [ ] Check if edges are in correct positions
- [ ] Apply U-perm or similar edge permutation
- [ ] If not solved, rotate U and try again (max 4 times)

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Solves ANY scramble (including 25-move) in 80-200 moves
- [ ] Runtime <100ms (no search, just algorithm application)
- [ ] 100% correctness on fuzz tests

### 6.3 Big Cube Support
