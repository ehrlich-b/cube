# TODO.md - Rubik's Cube Solver Development Plan

## üö® **REALITY CHECK: FUZZING EXPOSED THE TRUTH (January 2025)**

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Our comprehensive fuzzing test suite has revealed that the "working solvers" we thought we built are sophisticated placeholders that fail on real scrambles. This TODO.md was living in a fantasy world. Time to build the BEST cube solver tool in the world properly.

## üéØ **THE TRUTH: What Actually Works vs. What's Broken**

### ‚úÖ **SOLID FOUNDATION - These Work Perfectly**
- **Cube Representation**: Full NxN support (2x2 through 20x20+) with proper multi-layer moves
- **Move System**: WCA standard notation (M/E/S slices, Rw/Fw wide moves, 2R/3L layers, x/y/z rotations)
- **Visualization**: Beautiful ASCII/Unicode output with color support
- **Web Interface**: Full terminal emulator at `/terminal` with REST API
- **Algorithm Database**: 61 real speedcubing algorithms with lookup system
- **Pattern Highlighting**: Cross, OLL, PLL, F2L detection and visualization
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive 76-test suite including fuzzing
- **Headless Mode**: Programmatic output for `solve` and `verify` commands
- **All Infrastructure Commands**: twist, show, lookup, optimize, find all work perfectly

### üî• **BROKEN CORE - The Solvers Are Placeholders**

**BeginnerSolver**: 
- ‚ùå Only handles 5 hardcoded inverse patterns (`R` ‚Üí `R'`, etc.)
- ‚ùå For complex scrambles, randomly applies T-perm/U-perm up to 15 times hoping something works
- ‚ùå Produces 117-move "solutions" that don't actually solve the cube
- ‚ùå **FUZZ RESULT**: Fails on first complex scramble tested

**CFOPSolver**:
- ‚ùå **FUZZ RESULT**: 0/25 random scrambles solved (100% failure rate)
- ‚ùå Likely just calls BeginnerSolver or returns empty moves

**KociembaSolver**:
- ‚ùå **FUZZ RESULT**: 0/25 random scrambles solved (100% failure rate)  
- ‚ùå Likely just calls BeginnerSolver or returns empty moves

**Multi-dimensional Solving**:
- ‚ùå **FUZZ RESULT**: 2x2 cubes: 0/10 solved, 4x4 cubes: 0/5 solved
- ‚ùå Uses same broken algorithms on larger cubes

## üèóÔ∏è **THE REBUILD: Phase ‚àû - Make Solvers Actually Work**

**Goal**: Build the world's best command-line cube solver with REAL algorithms that actually solve cubes.

### üéØ **PRIORITY 1: Fix BeginnerSolver (Layer-by-Layer Method)**

**Real Beginner Method Steps:**
1. **White Cross** - Get white edges in correct positions
2. **White Corners** - Complete white face with corners
3. **Middle Layer** - Insert edge pieces into middle layer
4. **Yellow Cross** - Create cross on top (various cases)
5. **Yellow Corners** - Orient all yellow corners
6. **Corner Permutation** - Position yellow corners correctly
7. **Edge Permutation** - Position final edges correctly

**üîß CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENT: Grey Square System**

Layer-by-layer solving requires the ability to **ignore already-solved cubies** during pattern matching and verification. We need:

**Cubie Addressing System:**
```
Reading cube faces like a book (left-to-right, top-to-bottom):
Face positions: 1,2,3 / 4,5,6 / 7,8,9
  1 2 3
  4 5 6  <- 5 is center (doesn't move)
  7 8 9

3D cube numbering:
- Up face: 1-9
- Left face: 10-18  
- Front face: 19-27 (where 23 = front center)
- Right face: 28-36
- Back face: 37-45  
- Down face: 46-54
```

**Grey Square CLI Interface:**
```bash
# Verify white cross (only care about white edges + centers)
cube verify-layer "scramble" "solution" --care "2,4,6,8,23,14,32,41,50"

# Verify white corners (white face complete, ignore rest)  
cube verify-layer "scramble" "solution" --care "1-9" --dontcare "10-54"

# Check middle layer edges (ignore top/bottom layers)
cube verify-layer "scramble" "solution" --care "12,16,21,25,30,34,39,43" --dontcare "TL,BL"

# Using layer aliases for convenience
cube verify-layer "scramble" "solution" --care "WC" --dontcare "YL,ML"  # White cross, ignore yellow+middle
cube verify-layer "scramble" "solution" --dontcare "TE,BE"  # Don't care about top/bottom edges
```

**Layer and Piece Aliases:**
```bash
# Layer aliases
TL = "1-9"     # Top Layer (all 9 positions)
ML = "12,16,21,25,30,34,39,43"  # Middle Layer (edge positions)
BL = "46-54"   # Bottom Layer (all 9 positions)

# Piece type aliases  
TC = "1,3,7,9"     # Top Corners
TE = "2,4,6,8"     # Top Edges
MC = "11,13,17,19,29,31,35,37"  # Middle Corners (middle layer corners)
ME = "12,16,21,25,30,34,39,43"  # Middle Edges
BC = "46,48,52,54" # Bottom Corners
BE = "47,49,51,53" # Bottom Edges

# Face aliases
UF = "1-9"    # Up Face
LF = "10-18"  # Left Face  
FF = "19-27"  # Front Face
RF = "28-36"  # Right Face
BF = "37-45"  # Back Face
DF = "46-54"  # Down Face

# Common combinations
WC = "2,4,6,8,50"     # White Cross (white edges + white center)
WF = "1-9"            # White Face (complete white layer)
YC = "47,49,51,53,5"  # Yellow Cross (yellow edges + yellow center)
YF = "46-54"          # Yellow Face (complete yellow layer)
```

- [ ] **Edge cases fuzzed** - Empty scrambles, single moves, long scrambles
- [ ] **Performance testing** - Solutions under move count limits

### **No More Placeholder Acceptance**
- [ ] **Every algorithm must actually work** - No "gets lucky sometimes"
- [ ] **Every test must test real functionality** - No testing placeholder happy paths
