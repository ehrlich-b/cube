## üí° Development Philosophy

1. **Iterative Progress**: Each phase should produce working improvements
2. **Quality First**: Write tests before implementation to ensure correctness
3. **Honest Assessment**: Update progress based on reality, not aspirations
4. **Practical Focus**: The best solver is one that actually solves cubes

**Remember**: Perfect is the enemy of good. A working beginner solver beats a perfect plan.
