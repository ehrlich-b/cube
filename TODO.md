# TODO.md - Rubik's Cube Verified Algorithm Database

## üéØ **NEW FOCUS: Building a Verified Algorithm Database**

We're pivoting from solver implementation to building a robust foundation of verified algorithms. This database will become the bedrock for future solver development.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **PHASE 2: Enhanced Verification System**

### **Current State**
We have a basic `verify` command that checks if a solution solves a scramble. We need to dramatically enhance this to support verifying any algorithm with flexible start/end states.

### **The Vision: Universal Algorithm Verifier**

```bash
# Current (limited):
cube verify "R U R' U'" "U R U' R'"  # Does solution solve scramble?

# New (flexible):
cube verify "R U R' U R U2 R'" --start <cfen> --target <cfen>  # Does algorithm transform start to target?

# Examples:
# Verify Sune algorithm (OLL)
cube verify "R U R' U R U2 R'" \
  --start "YB|Y9/R3G3R3/B3W3B3/W9/O3Y3O3/G3R3G3" \  # OLL case
  --target "YB|Y9/?9/?9/?9/?9/?9"                    # Yellow face complete (rest wildcarded)

# Verify T-Perm (PLL)  
cube verify "R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R' U' R U R' F'" \
  --start "YB|Y9/?9/?9/W9/?9/?9" \                   # OLL complete
  --target "YB|Y9/R9/B9/W9/O9/G9"                    # Fully solved

# Verify F2L pair insertion
cube verify "U R U' R'" \
  --start "YB|?Y?YYY?Y?/?9/?9/W9/?9/?9" \           # White cross only
  --target "YB|?Y?YYY?Y?/??R??R??R/??B??B??B/W9/??O??O??O/??G??G??G"  # One F2L pair solved
```

### üéØ **Verification Enhancement Tasks**

**1. Redesign `verify` Command**
- [ ] Rename current `verify` to `verify-solve` (backwards compatibility)
- [ ] Create new `verify` command with `--start` and `--target` CFEN support
- [ ] Default `--start` to solved cube if not specified
- [ ] Default `--target` to solved cube if not specified
- [ ] Support algorithm chains (multiple algorithms in sequence)
- [ ] Add `--verbose` mode showing intermediate states

**2. Wildcard Semantics**
- [ ] Document precise wildcard behavior: `?` means "don't care about this sticker"
- [ ] Ensure wildcards work correctly for:
  - OLL: Only yellow face orientation matters
  - PLL: Last layer permutation matters, first two layers must stay solved
  - F2L: Specific slots matter, others can be wildcarded
  - Cross: Only 4 edge pieces matter

**3. Algorithm Categories**
- [ ] Define standard CFEN patterns for common algorithm types:
  - Cross patterns
  - F2L slot patterns  
  - OLL patterns (57 standard cases)
  - PLL patterns (21 standard cases)
  - Special patterns (parities, etc.)

## üìö **PHASE 3: Algorithm Database Schema**

### **Core Data Structure**

```go
type VerifiedAlgorithm struct {
    ID          string      // Unique identifier (e.g., "oll-27", "pll-t", "f2l-1")
    Name        string      // Human-readable name ("Sune", "T-Perm", etc.)
    Category    string      // "OLL", "PLL", "F2L", "CROSS", etc.
    Moves       string      // Algorithm notation ("R U R' U R U2 R'")
    StartCFEN   string      // Required starting state (with wildcards)
    TargetCFEN  string      // Expected ending state (with wildcards)
    
    // Metadata
    MoveCount   int         // Number of moves
    Recognition string      // Visual pattern description
    Probability float64     // Chance of occurring in solve
    Variants    []string    // Alternative algorithms for same case
    
    // Verification
    Verified    bool        // Has this been verified?
    TestedOn    []int       // Cube sizes tested (e.g., [3, 4, 5])
}
```

### üéØ **Database Implementation Tasks**
