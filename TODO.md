## ✅ **PHASE 2 COMPLETE: Enhanced Verification System**

### **✅ ACCOMPLISHED**
Phase 2 has been successfully completed! The enhanced verification system is fully functional and tested.

### **✅ Implemented Features**

```bash
# ✅ Flexible verification with CFEN start/target states
cube verify "R U R' U R U2 R'" --start "YB|Y2OY2BY2B/R2YGR2YR2/B2WB2YB3/W2RW6/GO8/GR2G6" --target "YB|Y9/?9/?9/W9/?9/?9"

# ✅ T-Perm verification (maintains top face, permutes sides)
cube verify "R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R' U' R U R' F'" --start "YB|Y9/R9/B9/W9/O9/G9" --target "YB|Y9/?9/?9/W9/?9/?9"

# ✅ Verbose mode showing all intermediate states
cube verify "U R U' R'" --start "YB|Y2OY2BY2B/R2YGR2YR2/B2WB2YB3/W2RW6/GO8/GR2G6" --target "YB|Y9/R9/B9/W9/O9/G9" --verbose

# ✅ Wildcard matching for pattern-based verification

## ✅ **PHASE 3 COMPLETE: Algorithm Database Schema & Clean Architecture**

### **✅ ACCOMPLISHED**
Phase 3 has been successfully completed! The algorithm database schema has been enhanced with verification capabilities, and the architecture has been cleaned up with proper separation of concerns.

### **✅ Enhanced Algorithm Database Schema**

**Enhanced Data Structure:**
```go
type Algorithm struct {
    // ✅ Core algorithm data (backward compatible)
    Name        string      // Human-readable name ("Sune", "T-Perm", etc.)
    Category    string      // "OLL", "PLL", "F2L", "CROSS", etc.
    Moves       string      // Algorithm notation ("R U R' U R U2 R'")
    Description string      // Visual pattern description
    CaseNumber  string      // e.g., "OLL 27", "PLL T"
    
    // ✅ Verification fields
    StartCFEN   string      // Required starting state (with wildcards)
    TargetCFEN  string      // Expected ending state (with wildcards)  
    Verified    bool        // Has this been verified?
    
    // ✅ Enhanced metadata
    MoveCount   int         // Number of moves (auto-calculated)
    Probability float64     // Chance of occurring in solve
    Variants    []string    // Alternative algorithms for same case
    TestedOn    []int       // Cube sizes tested (e.g., [3, 4, 5])
}
```

- ✅ **Anti-Sune Algorithm**: Real pattern from Sune case → solved
- ✅ **T-Perm Algorithm**: Real T-Perm case → solved state
- ✅ All patterns use actual CFEN states (no wildcard-only patterns)

**3. Database Enhancement** ✅
- ✅ Enhanced existing `AlgorithmDatabase` with verification metadata
- ✅ Added verified CFEN patterns to 3 core algorithms
- ✅ Created algorithm validation functions (`UpdateMoveCount`, `MarkVerified`)
- ✅ Implemented algorithm verification status tracking

**4. Clean Architecture with Separate Tools** ✅
- ✅ **Removed specialized commands from main CLI** (kept it clean and focused)
- ✅ **Created separate database tools** as standalone utilities:
  - `tools/verify-algorithm/` - Single algorithm verification
  - `tools/verify-database/` - Batch verification of all algorithms
- ✅ **Enhanced build system** with `make build-tools` and `make build-all-local`
- ✅ **Tools use cube package as library** (proper Go architecture)

### **✅ Current Verified Algorithm Database**
```bash
❯ ./dist/tools/verify-algorithm --list
Sune (OLL 27) - ✅ VERIFIED (tested on: [3])
Anti-Sune (OLL 26) - ✅ VERIFIED (tested on: [3])  
T-Perm (PLL T) - ✅ VERIFIED (tested on: [3])
```

### **✅ Clean CLI Interface**
```bash
❯ ./dist/cube help | grep verify
  verify        Verify an algorithm transforms start state to target state
  verify-cfen   Verify that a solution reaches the target CFEN state
```

### **✅ Working Database Tools**
```bash
# Single algorithm verification
./dist/tools/verify-algorithm "T-Perm" --verbose

# Batch database verification  
./dist/tools/verify-database --category OLL
```
