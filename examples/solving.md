# üé≤ Basic Solving Guide

Complete beginner's guide to using the Cube solver. Start here if you're new to Rubik's cubes or this solving tool.

## üöÄ Your First Moves

```bash
# Make sure you've built the project
cd .. && make build

# Start by exploring what moves do to the cube
./dist/cube twist "R U R' U'" --color
```

**What just happened?** 
- You applied the moves `R U R' U'` to a solved cube (turn Right face, then Up face, then Right counter-clockwise, then Up counter-clockwise)
- The `twist` command shows you exactly what the cube looks like after those moves
- The `--color` flag shows beautiful colored blocks instead of letters

## üß© Your First Solve

Now let's try solving that scrambled cube:

```bash
# Solve the scrambled state we just created
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'" --color
```

**What happened this time?**
- The solver found a solution to return the scrambled cube back to the solved state
- You can see both the scrambled state and the solution moves

## üî§ Understanding Move Notation

### Basic Face Moves
Each face of the cube has a letter:

| Letter | Face | Direction |
|--------|------|-----------|
| **R** | Right face | Clockwise 90¬∞ |
| **L** | Left face | Clockwise 90¬∞ |
| **U** | Up face (top) | Clockwise 90¬∞ |
| **D** | Down face (bottom) | Clockwise 90¬∞ |
| **F** | Front face | Clockwise 90¬∞ |
| **B** | Back face | Clockwise 90¬∞ |

### Modifiers
- **`'` (apostrophe)** = Counter-clockwise
- **`2`** = Double turn (180¬∞)

### Examples to Try

```bash
# Single moves - see what each move does
./dist/cube twist "R" --color       # Right face clockwise
./dist/cube twist "R'" --color      # Right face counter-clockwise  
./dist/cube twist "R2" --color      # Right face 180¬∞ turn

# Different faces
./dist/cube twist "U" --color       # Up face
./dist/cube twist "F" --color       # Front face
./dist/cube twist "L" --color       # Left face

# Now try solving those same moves
./dist/cube solve "R" --color       # Find solution for R
./dist/cube solve "R2" --color      # Find solution for R2
```

## üß© Simple Sequences

### Famous Beginner Sequences

```bash
# The "Sexy Move" - most famous sequence in cubing
./dist/cube twist "R U R' U'" --color    # See what it does
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'" --color    # Find the solution

# Right-hand algorithm (Sune)
./dist/cube twist "R U R' U R U2 R'" --color
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U R U2 R'" --color

# Left-hand algorithm  
./dist/cube twist "L' U' L U' L' U2 L" --color
./dist/cube solve "L' U' L U' L' U2 L" --color

# Simple triggers
./dist/cube twist "R U R'" --color       # See the pattern
./dist/cube solve "R U R'" --color       # Find solution
```

### Building Longer Sequences

```bash
# Combine simple moves - first explore, then solve
./dist/cube twist "R U" --color              # Right then Up
./dist/cube solve "R U" --color              # Find solution
./dist/cube solve "R U R'" --color           # Right, Up, Right back
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'" --color        # The sexy move
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U' R U R' U'" --color  # Double sexy move
```

## üéØ Different Cube Sizes

The solver supports cubes from 2x2 up to 10x10 and beyond!

### 2x2x2 Pocket Cube
```bash
# Smaller cube, simpler moves
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'" --dimension 2 --color

# Classic 2x2 sequences
./dist/cube solve "R U R' F R F'" --dimension 2 --color
./dist/cube solve "R U2 R' U' R U' R'" --dimension 2 --color
```

### 3x3x3 Standard Cube
```bash
# This is the default dimension
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'" --color
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'" --dimension 3 --color  # Same thing

# Famous 3x3 algorithms
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U R U2 R'" --color                    # Sune
./dist/cube solve "R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R'" --color   # T-Perm
```

### 4x4x4 Revenge Cube  
```bash
# Larger cube, same basic moves
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'" --dimension 4 --color

# 4x4 handles more complex scrambles
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U' R' F R F'" --dimension 4 --color
```

### 5x5x5 Professor Cube
```bash
# Even larger!
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'" --dimension 5 --color

# More complex patterns possible
./dist/cube solve "R U2 R' U' R U' R'" --dimension 5 --color
```

## ü§ñ Three Solving Algorithms

Our solver has three different algorithms that solve cubes in different ways:

### 1. Beginner Algorithm
**Best for**: Learning, understanding how cubes work
**Method**: Layer-by-layer approach

```bash
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'" --algorithm beginner --color
```

### 2. CFOP Algorithm  
**Best for**: Speedcubing, advanced users
**Method**: Cross ‚Üí F2L ‚Üí OLL ‚Üí PLL (the method used by speedcubers)

```bash
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'" --algorithm cfop --color
```

### 3. Kociemba Algorithm
**Best for**: Optimal solutions, mathematical interest  
**Method**: Two-phase algorithm for efficient solutions

```bash
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'" --algorithm kociemba --color
```

### Compare All Three
```bash
# See how each algorithm solves the same scramble differently
echo "=== BEGINNER ==="
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U' R' F R F'" --algorithm beginner --color

echo "=== CFOP ==="  
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U' R' F R F'" --algorithm cfop --color

echo "=== KOCIEMBA ==="
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U' R' F R F'" --algorithm kociemba --color
```

## üé® Visual Options

### Text vs Color Output

```bash
# Clean black and white (default)
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'"

# Beautiful colored blocks (recommended!)
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'" --color
```

The color output uses:
- üü¶ **Blue** for Blue face
- üü® **Yellow** for Yellow face  
- üü© **Green** for Green face
- üüß **Orange** for Orange face
- üü• **Red** for Red face
- ‚¨ú **White** for White face

## üß™ Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Single Moves
Try each face move and see what happens:

```bash
./dist/cube solve "R" --color     # Right
./dist/cube solve "L" --color     # Left  
./dist/cube solve "U" --color     # Up
./dist/cube solve "D" --color     # Down
./dist/cube solve "F" --color     # Front
./dist/cube solve "B" --color     # Back
```

### Exercise 2: Modifiers
Learn the modifiers by practicing:

```bash
./dist/cube solve "R" --color     # Clockwise
./dist/cube solve "R'" --color    # Counter-clockwise
./dist/cube solve "R2" --color    # Double turn
```

### Exercise 3: Building Sequences
Start simple and build up:

```bash
./dist/cube solve "R U" --color           # Two moves
./dist/cube solve "R U R'" --color        # Three moves  
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'" --color     # Four moves (sexy move)
```

### Exercise 4: Different Cubes
Try the same sequence on different cube sizes:

```bash
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'" --dimension 2 --color   # 2x2
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'" --dimension 3 --color   # 3x3
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'" --dimension 4 --color   # 4x4
```

## üéØ Cool Patterns to Try

### Beginner-Friendly Patterns

```bash
# Checkerboard pattern
./dist/cube solve "R2 L2 U2 D2 F2 B2" --color

# Four spots pattern  
./dist/cube solve "F R U' R' F' R U R'" --color

# Cross pattern
./dist/cube solve "F B' R L F B' R L" --color
```

### Classic Algorithms

```bash
# Sune - most common OLL case
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U R U2 R'" --color

# Antisune
./dist/cube solve "R U2 R' U' R U' R'" --color

# T-Perm - swaps two adjacent corners
./dist/cube solve "R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R'" --color
```

## üîç Understanding Solutions

The solver shows you:
- **Scramble**: The moves that mixed up the cube
- **Solution**: The moves needed to solve it
- **Steps**: How many moves in the solution
- **Duration**: How long the algorithm took

```bash
# Example output:
# Solving 3x3x3 cube...
# Using algorithm: beginner
# Solution: U R U' R'  
# Solved in 4 steps (took 1.2ms)
```

## üö® Common Beginner Mistakes

### 1. Mixing up `'` and `2`
- `R'` = Right counter-clockwise (90¬∞)
- `R2` = Right double turn (180¬∞)

### 2. Forgetting spaces in sequences
```bash
# ‚ùå Wrong - no spaces
./dist/cube solve "RUR'U'" 

# ‚úÖ Correct - spaces between moves
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'" 
```

### 3. Case sensitivity
```bash
# ‚ùå Wrong - lowercase
./dist/cube solve "r u r' u'"

# ‚úÖ Correct - uppercase
./dist/cube solve "R U R' U'"
```
